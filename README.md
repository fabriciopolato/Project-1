# CHARADA
Project 1 - Ironhack Game

## AKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to thank IronHack Brazil for all support along the course that was fundamental for the conclusion of this project.

## THE PROJECT
This project was part of the Web Development Bootcamp at IronHack Brazil. This is the first of three projects that are mandatory to graduate at the course.
All the used knowledge in this project was acquired during the first 2 weeks of bootcamp.

## THE GAME
Charada is the Portuguese word for charade. The main goal of this game is to find out the secret word on the right side of the screen, letter by letter. The goal of the game is to find out all the right letters of the secret word. If you catch 3 wrong letters, you lose the game. This game reassembles the Hangman game in some way.
You can start the game by pressing the PLAY button. After you have done it once, use the RESTART button to play again. You can select the difficulty of the game at any time. If you don't do it, don't worry, the game will select the EASY difficulty as standard.

### INSTRUCTIONS
1. Use the arrow keys (right ans left) to move the dictionary. 
1. At the right side of the screen, white dashes show the number of letters of the secret word.
1. The first hint appears below the dashes, so you can start to guess the letters.
1. When you start the game, letters start to fall out.
1. While the letters are falling, you must move the dictionary to try to collect the letters you think are included in the secret word.
1. If you get a wrong letter, you commit an error.
1. At each error, a new hint is released, so you can guess more accurately.
1. Be aware, at the end of three errors, you lose the game.

## DEVELOPING
* This game was entirely drawn using *Canvas*. 
* Some knowledge in *DOM manipulation* was also used to activate the buttons.
* The entire game was coded using *HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap* and *JavaScript*.
* For the game to perform as intended, I worked with colisions and intervals.


## FURTHER INFORMATION
The game presents some minor bugs that I intend to fix when I have available time.
Below, there are some bugs I noted so far:

- [ ] First time you play the game, it can start really fast regardless the difficulty. When you reload the page, it comes back to the right speed.
- [ ] After you press PLAY, if you press it again it will make the screen to blink.
- [ ] First time the player appears, it blinks on the screen.
